The machine learning algorithms used in our framework are interchangeable, but it is challenging to determine which algorithm is best suited for a particular scenario. We have organized the algorithms we are familiar with as follows.

Decision tree is a tree-like model used for classification and regression. It is a non-parametric method that can handle both categorical and numerical data.
