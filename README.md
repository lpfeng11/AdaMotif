# AdaMotif

***AdaMotif***: Graph Simplification via Adaptive Motif Design

## Installation

Configure two Python environments using conda: one for the py folder and another for the align folder. The specific package information is in the requirements.txt file in each corresponding folder. Currently, running code from different environments can only be done by relying on these separate environments.

## Run

1. Run `./run.py` in the py folder to process and obtain graph community-related data. 

2. Run the files in the align folder to obtain alignment data. 

3. Run the frontend files in the html folder to save the links of the subgraph nodes locally, in order to obtain the subgraph style data within the graph pattern. 

4. Run Matlab to generate the outline information of the graph pattern.

The code is implemented and tested in modules, so currently, it can only be executed sequentially by module. The data dependencies between the modules are generated and stored in the 'data_processed' folder during execution. Since many machine learning algorithms are used in the framework, the data generated by these algorithms will differ slightly each time. As a result, although the visualization methods are stable, the final visualization outcomes will have differences.
